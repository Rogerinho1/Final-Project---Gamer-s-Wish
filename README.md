This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Gamer's Wish
Workshop #1 - Creating a sample webpage for invented furniture store using CSS.

## Introduction

The website is a final project for the JavaScript: React course in Coders Lab Programming School. Below you can find hints how to start the webpage.
!!!ALERT!!! - Unfortunately, the owners of the API have blocked the usage of the API on a local host, therefore in order to start the page in the browser one might need the ACAO (Allow-Control-Allow-Origin) plugin. Only then will the webpage start. Remember to turn it off afterwards because it will prever other things from working such as Youtube or Facebook.

## Future Updates

* RWD
* adjust the colors
* remove from the list button
* naming the list
* possibility to download the list to a .pdf
* different layouts for lists

### Home Page

## Main Features

* fully working searchbar with hover effect
* API downloads & updates the content very fast
* possibility to add positions from the main list to the wishlist
* saving the list to .pdf file [<b>to be added this week</b>]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
